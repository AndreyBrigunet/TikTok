# TikTok API

The published code is just experimental. You can expect a full TikTok API by the end of this week :smile:

I am still thinking how to deliver Gorgon and device registration algorithm so no one gets pissed off.

### Currently available

The following is currently available for researching and development:

- Device registration for registering `device_id`, `install_id` also known as `iid` and `openudid`.

ETA for the full API depends on how long it takes me to perfectly implement all algorithms.
