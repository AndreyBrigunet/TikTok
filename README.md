- **ETA:** 21-27 Jan. :smile:

I am still thinking how to deliver Gorgon and device registration algorithm so no one gets pissed off.

### Currently available

The following is currently available for researchers and developers:

- Device registration for registering `device_id`, `install_id` also known as `iid` and `openudid`.
- `X-Gorgon` and `X-Khronos`.
- Captcha solver
