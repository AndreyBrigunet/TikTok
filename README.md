<br>

**Note:** Since many of you are asking me via email. Yes, I have already reversed everything. I will be gradually pushing code.

### TikTok Service

If you are a student or a security researcher you will have limited free access to the TikTok service. Send me an email with all details and your main usages of the API and I will provide you an auth key.

For any individual or company that is interested in using the API in a large scale, you should send me an email providing details about how are you planning to use the API and the estimated requests on a monthly basis.

The service includes:

- Device registration for registering `device_id`, `install_id` also known as `iid` and `openudid`.
- `X-Gorgon` and `X-Khronos`.
- Captcha solver

If you want to contact with me: me [ at ] mgp25 [ dot ] com

Best regards,
